# bb84

### To install:
`pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`
If you're using a virtualenv, you will need to install cqc and simulaqron outside of it as well **if you know how to work around this feel free to let me know**

### To run:
`alice.py` and `bob.py` are two example clients on how two parties would use the library.
You will have to configure simulaqron to have at least 3n qubits, where n is the number of bits in your key.
